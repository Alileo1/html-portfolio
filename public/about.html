<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Well, depending on where you're viewing the story from there could be a lot about me that is needed to be known. </p>

<p>Currently, I'm a single dad, who is trying to better is world for his two beautiful kids. Everythin I do in this world, is as  a result of the things that I could better provide for my kids and their future. They're growing so quickly every single day. My oldest is 10, and my younest is 9. Everyday, time rolls by, and they get older, a little taller, and loose their cutest attributes. I feel as though everyday I'm missing out on significant time with them. </p>

<p>Given the complexities between the split of their mother and myself, I do not get near enough time with them. As such, I miss out on all the important things that are going on and happening in their lives today. It's a sad state of affairs, one that I truly hope will get better with some more time. </p>
